Golang implementation of a binary search tree.

## Basic Usage
This implementation differentiates between key and value.  That is to say, the value of each node does not need to
be equal to the key.

Some considerations:

1. Keys are globally unique
2. Values are not globally unique
3. Once set

## Usage
See [main/main.go](main/main.go) for some examples on how to use this
